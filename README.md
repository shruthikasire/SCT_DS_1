Task 01: Data Visualization using Bar Chart / Histogram
📌 Overview
This project focuses on visualizing the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using bar charts or histograms. The goal is to understand population patterns such as age groups or gender distribution through clear and meaningful visual representations.
For this task, a sample population age distribution dataset is used to demonstrate how data visualization helps in analyzing demographic trends.

🎯 Objectives
Understand how to visualize data distributions
Create bar charts or histograms using a sample dataset
Interpret insights from visualized population data

📂 Dataset Description
The sample dataset represents population distribution by age groups, for example:
0–20 years
21–64 years
65+ years
Each group contains population counts (in millions) and percentage distribution.

📈 Visualization Techniques Used
Bar Chart – Used for categorical age groups
Histogram – Used to show continuous age distribution
These visualizations help identify:
Dominant age groups
Population spread
Median age trends

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Pandas
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
